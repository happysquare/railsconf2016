##Rediscovering ActiveRecord: Mario Alberto Chavez
- [Work](https://michelada.io/)
- [Git](https://github.com/mariochavez)
Summary:
>Being a Rails developer is more than just understanding how to use the
>Framework to develop applications.

>To become an efficient developer, you should learn how the Framework works; how
>deep this understanding should be is up to you. Exploring the Framework code is
>something that everyone should do at least once.

>Not only may you learn how it works but also, you might learn new tricks from
>the code itself or discover small features that are not widely publicized.

##Inside ActiveJob: Jerry D'Antonio
- [Git](https://github.com/jdantonio)
Summary:
>ActiveJob made a huge impact when it landed Rails 4.2. Most job processors
>support it and many developers use it. But few ever need to dig into the
>internals. How exactly does ActiveJob allow us to execute performant,
>thread-safe, asynchronous jobs in a language not known for concurrency? This
>talk will answer that question. We'll build our own asynchronous job processor
>from scratch and along the way we'll take a deep dive into queues, job
>serialization, scheduled tasks, and Ruby's memory model.

##Mastering the Product Discovery Canvas: Bill Allen
- [Git *...I think*](https://github.com/Bill-A)

Summary:
>Building successful products that customers really want and love is very hard.
>In fact, most product efforts fail!
>
>In this workshop I introduce you to the Product Discovery Canvas; it applies
>relevant elements of Collaborative Chartering, Customer Discovery, User Story
>Mapping, Pretotyping and Lean Startup for product discovery and product
>validation. The canvas starts with techniques for narrowing ‘product ideas’ to
>the ‘ideal product’. It ends with techniques for you to inexpensively answer the
>question, “If you build it, will people buy it and use it?” or “Should you build
>it at all?”

##ActionCable for Not-Another-Chat-App-Please: Jesse Wolgamott
- [Work](https://www.theironyard.com/)
- [Git](https://github.com/jwo)
- [WWW](http://jessewolgamott.com/books/)

Summary:
>RealTime updates using WebSockets are so-hot-right-now, and Rails 5 introduces
>ActionCable to let the server talk to the browser. Usually, this is shown as a
>Chat application -- but very few services actually use chats.
>
>Instead, Rails Apps want to be able to update pages with new inventory
>information, additional products, progress bars, and the rare notification. How
>can we make this happen in the real world? How can we handle this for
>unauthenticated users? How can we deploy this?

##Rails 5 Features You Haven't Heard About: Sean Griffin
- [Git](https://github.com/sgrif)

Summary:
>We've all heard about Action Cable, Turbolinks 5, and Rails::API. But Rails 5
>was almost a thousand commits! They included dozens of minor features, many of
>which will be huge quality of life improvements even if you aren't using
>WebSockets or Turbolinks.
>
>This will be a deep look at several of the "minor" features of Rails 5. You
>won't just learn about the features, but you'll learn about why they were added,
>the reasoning behind them, and the difficulties of adding them from someone
>directly involved in many of them.

##Rails on Google Cloud Platform: Jeff Mendoza, Aja Hammerly
- [Git Jeff](https://github.com/jeffmendoza)
- [Git Aja *...I think*](https://github.com/kushali)

Summary:
>In this workshop, you'll go from 'rails new' to a fully functioning Rails app on
>Google Cloud Platform. We’ll connect to hosted MySQL, Google authentication, and
>other Google Cloud Platform services to build a scalable non-trivial
>application.

##Finding Translations: Localization and Internationalization: Valerie Woolard
-[Git](https://github.com/valeriecodes)
-[WWW](http://www.valeriewoolard.com/)

Summary:
>Translation, be it a word, sentence, concept, or idea, for different audiences
>has always been a challenge. This talk tackles problems of translation,
>especially those that tend to crop up in building software. We'll dive into the
>eminently practical—how to design apps for easier localization, common pitfalls,
>solutions for managing translations, approaches to version control with
>translations—and the more subjective—possible impacts of cultural differences,
>and what makes a "good" translation.
